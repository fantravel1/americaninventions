        <!-- Introduction -->
        <section id="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>This Cuban physician discovered that mosquitoes transmit yellow fever, revolutionizing tropical medicine and saving millions of lives through vector control.</p>
            <p>Carlos Juan Finlay was born in Camagüey, Cuba, to a Scottish father and French mother. He studied medicine in France and the United States before returning to Cuba to practice. In 1881, Finlay proposed his revolutionary theory that yellow fever was transmitted by mosquitoes, specifically the Aedes aegypti species. His theory was initially rejected by the medical establishment, but was later proven...</p>

        <!-- Ideation: How, Why, With What -->
        <section id="ideation">
            <h2>💭 Ideation: How, Why, and With What</h2>
            <p>The genesis of the Yellow Fever Transmission Theory emerged from a profound need in the medical field. Carlos Finlay observed firsthand the challenges faced by patients and medical practitioners. Through meticulous observation and scientific inquiry, they identified a critical gap that existing solutions failed to address.</p>
<p>The "why" was rooted in improving patient outcomes and accessibility to healthcare. The "how" began with Carlos Finlay's deep understanding of medicine & healthcare principles, combined with innovative thinking that challenged conventional approaches.</p>
<p>Working with materials and methods available in the early 1880s, Carlos Finlay began sketching initial concepts. The ideation phase involved extensive research into biological systems, chemical compounds, and mechanical processes. They collaborated with colleagues, consulted medical literature, and drew inspiration from both traditional practices and emerging scientific discoveries.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Design and Brainstorming -->
        <section id="design">
            <h2>✏️ Design and Brainstorming</h2>
            <p>The design and brainstorming phase for the Yellow Fever Transmission Theory was intensive and iterative. Carlos Finlay understood that moving from concept to reality required meticulous planning and creative problem-solving.</p>
<h3>Initial Sketches and Diagrams</h3>
<p>The first designs were rough - pencil sketches on paper, annotated with measurements and material specifications. Carlos Finlay created multiple variations, each exploring different approaches to solving the core technical challenges. These early drawings reveal a mind wrestling with fundamental questions of form and function.</p>
<h3>Collaborative Refinement</h3>
<p>While Carlos Finlay was the driving force, the design process benefited from feedback and collaboration. They consulted with:
- Technical experts who could evaluate feasibility
- Potential users who provided practical insights
- Material suppliers who explained what was possible with available resources
- Financial advisors who helped understand manufacturing costs</p>
<h3>Design Iterations</h3>
<p>The first design was far from the final one. Through a process of constant refinement, Carlos Finlay improved upon each iteration:</p>
<p>1. **Version 1.0** - The initial concept, bold but impractical in certain aspects
2. **Version 2.0** - Addressed manufacturing challenges, simplified complex components
3. **Version 3.0** - Enhanced user experience, improved reliability
4. **Final Design** - The synthesis of all learnings, ready for prototyping</p>
<h3>Materials Selection</h3>
<p>Choosing the right materials was critical. Carlos Finlay evaluated options based on:
- Availability and cost
- Durability and performance characteristics
- Ease of manufacturing and assembly
- Environmental conditions the invention would face</p>
<p>The final material selections reflected a balance of ideal performance and practical constraints of the era.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Prototyping -->
        <section id="prototyping">
            <h2>🔧 Prototyping</h2>
            <p>The journey from design to physical prototype was fraught with challenges, setbacks, and breakthroughs. Carlos Finlay approached prototyping with both scientific rigor and creative flexibility.</p>
<h3>The First Prototype</h3>
<p>Constructing the first working model of the Yellow Fever Transmission Theory required resourcefulness. In 1881, manufacturing capabilities were limited compared to today. Carlos Finlay often had to:
- Source materials from multiple suppliers
- Commission custom-made components
- Adapt existing tools for new purposes
- Solve unexpected technical problems on the fly</p>
<p>The first prototype was assembled in a modest workshop, with Carlos Finlay personally overseeing every detail. When it was finally complete and they activated it for the first time, the moment was both triumphant and humbling - it worked, but not perfectly.</p>
<h3>Testing and Refinement</h3>
<p>The initial prototype revealed numerous issues that weren't apparent in the design phase:
- Mechanical components that wore out faster than expected
- User interface elements that proved confusing
- Performance metrics that fell short of targets
- Manufacturing steps that were too complex or expensive</p>
<p>Carlos Finlay documented each problem meticulously, understanding that failure was information. They ran the prototype through rigorous testing protocols, measuring performance, identifying weak points, and gathering data.</p>
<h3>Iteration Cycles</h3>
<p>Over the following months, Carlos Finlay built multiple prototypes, each incorporating lessons from the previous version:</p>
<h3>Prototype 2: Addressed the most critical mechanical failures, introduced more durable materials
Prototype 3: Refined the user experience, simplified operation
Prototype 4: Optimized for manufacturing efficiency
Final Prototype: Met all performance targets, ready for production</h3>
<h3>Validation Testing</h3>
<p>Before moving to manufacturing, Carlos Finlay conducted extensive validation:
- Stress testing under extreme conditions
- Long-duration reliability trials
- User testing with the target audience
- Safety verification to ensure no harm</p>
<p>The final prototype was tested until Carlos Finlay was confident it would perform reliably in the real world.</p>

        <!-- Manufacturing and Creation -->
        <section id="manufacturing">
            <h2>🏭 Manufacturing and Creation</h2>
            <p>Transitioning from a working prototype to full-scale manufacturing presented an entirely new set of challenges. Carlos Finlay had to think beyond invention and become an entrepreneur and production manager.</p>
<h3>Manufacturing Strategy</h3>
