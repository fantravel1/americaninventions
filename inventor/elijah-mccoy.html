        <section id="biography">
            <h2>From Freedom to Innovation</h2>
            <p>
                Elijah J. McCoy was born on May 2, 1844, in Colchester, Ontario, Canada—a free child in a nation that had abolished slavery. But his parents, George and Mildred McCoy, had not always been free. They were formerly enslaved people who had escaped from Kentucky via the Underground Railroad, risking their lives for freedom in Canada. They settled in Ontario, where they could raise their children without the threat of slave catchers or the brutality of bondage.
            </p>
            <p>
                Growing up in Canada as the child of freedom-seekers, young Elijah demonstrated an early fascination with mechanical devices and how things worked. His parents, understanding the value of education they had been denied under slavery, encouraged their son's intellectual curiosity. Elijah showed particular aptitude for mathematics and mechanical problem-solving, skills that would define his career.
            </p>
            <p>
                Recognizing Elijah's exceptional talent, his parents sent him to Edinburgh, Scotland, when he was approximately 15 years old to receive formal training in mechanical engineering. This was an extraordinary opportunity for a young Black man in the mid-19th century. In Scotland, McCoy studied mechanical engineering and served an apprenticeship, receiving rigorous technical education that would make him one of the most qualified mechanical engineers of his generation.
            </p>

            <h3>The Bitter Reality of American Racism</h3>
            <p>
                After completing his education in Scotland around 1865, McCoy returned to North America. The Civil War had just ended, and the McCoy family moved to Ypsilanti, Michigan, hoping the United States would offer opportunities for a formally trained Black engineer. They were tragically wrong.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite his advanced European engineering degree and certification, McCoy discovered that no American company would hire a Black man as an engineer, regardless of his qualifications. The color of his skin mattered more than the content of his credentials. Railroads and factories sought engineers, but they wanted white engineers. McCoy's expertise was dismissed because of racism.
            </p>
            <p>
                Facing economic necessity, McCoy took a job with the Michigan Central Railroad as a fireman and oilman—positions far beneath his qualifications. As a fireman, he shoveled coal into locomotive steam engines. As an oilman, he performed one of the most dangerous and labor-intensive tasks in railroad operations: manually lubricating the moving parts of trains.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the 1860s, trains had to stop every few miles so workers could manually oil the numerous moving parts of the locomotive. These stops wasted time and money. The manual lubrication was also extremely dangerous—workers had to apply oil to moving machinery, risking severe injury or death if they slipped or got caught in the mechanisms.
            </p>

            <h3>Turning Frustration into Innovation</h3>
            <p>
                Rather than accept this dangerous inefficiency, McCoy's engineering mind began searching for a solution. Working in his home workshop during off-hours, he designed an automatic lubricator—a device that would oil engine parts while the train was running, eliminating the need for frequent, dangerous stops.
            </p>
            <p>
                On July 23, 1872, McCoy received U.S. Patent No. 129,843 for his "Improvement in Lubricators for Steam Engines." His invention was brilliantly simple yet highly effective. It used a cup-like container that regulated the flow of oil through a tube to the engine's moving parts. The oil dripped at a controlled, steady rate, ensuring continuous lubrication without human intervention.
            </p>
            <p>
                The impact was immediate and revolutionary. Trains equipped with McCoy's automatic lubricator no longer needed to stop for manual oiling. They could run longer distances, operate more efficiently, and eliminate the dangerous job of oiling moving machinery. Railroad companies saved enormous amounts of time and money while improving worker safety.
            </p>

            <h3>The Real McCoy: A Legend of Quality</h3>
            <p>
                McCoy's lubricator was so superior to competing devices that railroad engineers and purchasers began asking specifically for "The Real McCoy" to ensure they were getting McCoy's authentic invention rather than inferior imitations. This phrase entered American English as an idiom meaning "the genuine article" or "the authentic version of something."
            </p>
            <p>
                While the exact origin of the phrase is debated by linguists (some attributing it to other sources), the association with Elijah McCoy is strong and widely accepted. His lubricator was indeed "the real thing"—a superior product that imitators could not match.
            </p>
            <p>
                McCoy didn't stop with his first lubricator. Over his career, he received 57 patents for various inventions, most related to lubrication systems for different types of machinery. He developed lubricators for marine engines, mining equipment, factory machinery, and construction equipment. Each invention improved efficiency and safety across multiple industries.
            </p>

            <h3>Entrepreneurship and Continued Innovation</h3>
            <p>
                In 1920, at age 76, McCoy established the Elijah McCoy Manufacturing Company in Detroit to manufacture and sell his lubricators directly. This was a remarkable achievement—at a time when few Black Americans owned businesses, McCoy created a company to commercialize his own inventions.
            </p>
            <p>
                McCoy continued inventing into his eighties. His later patents included an improved ironing board design and a lawn sprinkler system. But his lubricating devices remained his most significant contribution, transforming industrial operations across America and worldwide.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tragically, McCoy's later years were marked by personal loss. In 1922, he and his wife Mary were involved in an automobile accident. Mary died from her injuries, and Elijah never fully recovered. He was admitted to Eloise Infirmary (a facility for elderly and disabled people in Nankin Township, Michigan), where he died on October 10, 1929, at age 85.

            <p>
                Elijah McCoy's life encapsulates both the triumph of genius and the tragedy of racism. Here was a formally trained mechanical engineer—educated in Europe, certified in his profession—who couldn't find work as an engineer in America because of the color of his skin. Yet rather than accept this injustice passively, McCoy used his position as a railroad worker to identify problems and engineer solutions.

                His automatic lubricator didn't just make trains more efficient; it transformed industrial operations across multiple sectors. Factories, mines, ships, and railroads worldwide adopted his technology. The phrase "The Real McCoy" became synonymous with quality and authenticity—a fitting tribute to an inventor whose work was indeed the genuine article.

                McCoy's story also illustrates the hidden contributions of Black inventors to the Industrial Revolution. While history books often credit only white industrialists and inventors, the truth is that Black inventors like McCoy, Granville Woods, Lewis Latimer, and others made critical contributions to the technologies that powered industrial progress. Their innovations saved lives, increased productivity, and generated enormous wealth—though they themselves often received limited financial reward.

                Today, McCoy is finally receiving recognition commensurate with his achievements. His induction into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2001 acknowledged his revolutionary contributions to industrial technology. Schools, streets, and programs across North America bear his name. His story reminds us that genius and innovation know no racial boundaries, and that society progresses most when it values talent regardless of the inventor's background.

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">Who was Elijah McCoy and what did he invent?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    Elijah McCoy was an African American inventor who created the Automatic Lubricator for steam engines in 1872. His device allowed trains and industrial machinery to be lubricated while in operation, eliminating dangerous and costly shutdowns. He held 57 patents throughout his career and is believed to be the origin of the phrase "The Real McCoy," meaning the genuine article.

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">What does "The Real McCoy" mean?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    The phrase "The Real McCoy" means "the genuine article" or "the authentic version of superior quality." It originated from Elijah McCoy's automatic lubricator, which was so superior to competing devices that railroad engineers would ask specifically if a locomotive was equipped with "The Real McCoy" and not an inferior imitation. The phrase entered American English as an idiom for authenticity and quality.

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">How did Elijah McCoy's Automatic Lubricator work?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    McCoy's Automatic Lubricator used a cup-like container that regulated the flow of oil through a tube to the engine's moving parts. The oil dripped at a controlled, steady rate, ensuring continuous lubrication without human intervention. This eliminated the need to shut down trains and factories for manual oiling, saving enormous time and money while preventing dangerous manual lubrication of moving machinery.

                <div class="faq-question">What obstacles did Elijah McCoy overcome?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    McCoy's parents were escaped slaves who fled to Canada via the Underground Railroad. Despite earning a mechanical engineering degree in Scotland, McCoy couldn't find engineering work in America due to racial discrimination. He worked as a railroad fireman and oilman—jobs far beneath his qualifications—but used this experience to develop his revolutionary automatic lubricator. He overcame systemic racism to become one of the most prolific Black inventors in American history with 57 patents.
