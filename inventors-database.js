            shortBio: "At just 23 years old, this brilliant Mexican engineer invented the first color television system in 1940, revolutionizing how the world would experience visual media forever.",
            detailedBio: "Guillermo González Camarena was born in Guadalajara, Mexico, in 1917. From an early age, he showed exceptional aptitude for electronics and engineering. Despite financial hardships, his passion for innovation drove him to experiment with television technology in his makeshift laboratory. At the age of 23, González Camarena made history by inventing the chromoscopic adapter for television equipment, which allowed the transmission of color images. This groundbreaking invention earned him Mexican patent #40,235 and later U.S. patent #2,296,019. His invention was revolutionary because it used a simple system of rotating color filters that could be easily integrated into existing black-and-white television systems. This made color television accessible and affordable, paving the way for the colorful world of modern television.",

He immigrated to the United States and settled in Lynn, Massachusetts, where he worked in shoe factories. Matzeliger observed that attaching the upper part of shoes to the sole was done entirely by hand, making it slow and expensive. He spent years developing a machine that could perform this 'lasting' process automatically. His invention revolutionized the shoe industry, reducing the cost of shoes by 50% and making quality footwear affordable for working-class Americans.",

            shortBio: "This Cuban physician discovered that mosquitoes transmit yellow fever, revolutionizing tropical medicine and saving millions of lives through vector control.",
            detailedBio: "Carlos Juan Finlay was born in Camagüey, Cuba, to a Scottish father and French mother. He studied medicine in France and the United States before returning to Cuba to practice. In 1881, Finlay proposed his revolutionary theory that yellow fever was transmitted by mosquitoes, specifically the Aedes aegypti species. His theory was initially rejected by the medical establishment, but was later proven correct by Walter Reed's commission. Finlay's discovery led to mosquito control programs that eliminated yellow fever from many regions and made possible the construction of the Panama Canal.",
            impact: "His mosquito transmission theory eliminated yellow fever from many regions and enabled major engineering projects like the Panama Canal.",

            detailedBio: "Francisco Cabrera was born in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, and became a meteorologist specializing in tropical weather systems. Growing up in a hurricane-prone region, he witnessed firsthand the devastation these storms could cause. Cabrera developed an advanced computer modeling system that improved hurricane tracking and intensity prediction by combining satellite data, ocean temperature readings, and atmospheric pressure measurements. His system provided earlier and more accurate warnings, giving communities more time to prepare and evacuate.",
