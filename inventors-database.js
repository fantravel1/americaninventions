Frustrated with existing flat ironing boards that made it difficult to iron sleeves and fitted garments properly, Boone designed an improved version. Her ironing board had a narrow, curved surface that was perfect for pressing sleeves and the fitted seams of women's garments. The board was also collapsible and featured padding, making it more efficient and comfortable to use.",

While working at the University of California, Irvine, he and his colleagues discovered that chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) used in refrigerators and aerosols were destroying the Earth's ozone layer. Their research showed how these chemicals could create a hole in the ozone, allowing dangerous UV radiation to reach Earth. This groundbreaking work led to the Montreal Protocol in 1987, which banned CFCs worldwide and prevented a global environmental disaster.",

            category: "Environmental Technology",
            shortBio: "This Trinidadian environmental engineer developed biological systems that use Caribbean bacteria to clean up oil spills, protecting marine ecosystems naturally.",
            detailedBio: "Jennifer Mohammed was born in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, and became an environmental engineer specializing in marine pollution. She developed a bioremediation system using naturally occurring Caribbean bacteria that can break down oil spills without harmful chemicals. Her system includes specially cultivated bacteria that consume oil while producing harmless byproducts. The technology has been used to clean up oil spills in Caribbean waters and has helped protect coral reefs and marine life.",
            impact: "Her bioremediation system has cleaned up oil spills naturally while protecting Caribbean marine ecosystems.",
